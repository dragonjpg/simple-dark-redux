# simple-dark-redux
flight rising userstyle. a rewrite of the [simple dark theme](https://userstyles.org/styles/150521/simple-dark-theme-for-flight-rising).

notes:
- color scheme using css variables. as a result, it has two themes and will eventually be updated with other themes, as well as an option for a custom theme.
- uses css filters to adjust the hues of UI elements instead of image replacements in most instances. only 11 image replacements total are used, down from several hundred.
